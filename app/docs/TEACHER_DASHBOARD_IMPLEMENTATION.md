### 5. Mock Data

Comprehensive mock data is provided for development:

- Teacher profile information
- Sample student referrals
- Assignment examples
- Progress report samples
- Provider listings
- Statistics data

### 6. Navigation

Updated teacher navigation includes:

- Dashboard
- My Students
- Refer Student
- Assignments
- Progress Reports
- Available Providers

## Usage

### Development

The implementation automatically falls back to mock data when the backend API is not available, making it perfect for frontend development and testing.

### Production

When the backend API is available, all endpoints will use real data. The API client handles authentication, error handling, and response processing automatically.
